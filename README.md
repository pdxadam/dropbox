Keeps your Dropbox clean.
This project is based on the Dropbox api. It pulls images from the camera uploads folder and saves them to a local directory before deleting it from Dropbox.

Go to Dropbox App Console to create your own App. Give it files.content.read and files.content.write permissions. Then generate a token and put it in a dbToken file.
